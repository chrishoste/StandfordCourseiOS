# StandfordCourseiOS
I am following the Standford iOS-Development course on iTunesU or Youtube to improve my skills in Swift 3.

We will build a calculator for iPhone and iPad.

What I learned from the first lecture of this course ?
  1. We created a new Project and we also took a look to the IDE (Xcode)
  2. We created a simple Layout with some buttons and a label to display the result.
  3. After we created the Layout, we connected everything to the ViewController.
  4. Functions/If-Statements/Optinals/SwitchCase/Computed Properties(GET/SET)

## Calculator
